# [TAR System](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/tar-system/id6448125946)
This app lets you verify the authenticity of wines with a TAR seal using your smartphoneâ€™s NFC reader. It ensures complete traceability from production to sale, provides consumer reviews, offers food pairing recommendations from the winery, and exclusive promotions for users who scan the TAR label. Advanced technology guarantees authenticity, with each bottle having a unique code for direct feedback to the winery.

Conceptualized and developed the app with a strong focus on ease of use and optimal performance. Oversaw the Apple App Store submission, ensuring a smooth launch, and maintained the app with ongoing updates, bug fixes, and the implementation of new features to continuously improve user satisfaction.
